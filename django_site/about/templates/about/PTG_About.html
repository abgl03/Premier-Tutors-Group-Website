          <h2>The Premier Story</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9 premier-story">
          <p class="purple">Premier Tutors Group is a tutoring collective that aims to bring tutors and students
together in a collaborative and social way. We are based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
          <p class="purple">In Auckland, there is a huge gap between what students were paying for tutoring,
and what the tutors themselves were getting paid. Many companies charge upwards
of $35 an hour per student, while tutors get paid minimum wage, despite doing the
majority of the work.</p>
          <p class="purple">Our collective began as an association for the benefit of tutors and students alike.
We wanted to act as a liaison between these two groups, allowing for lower costs to
students, as well as higher wages for tutors. At Premier Tutors Group, your tutor or
proofreader will always be fairly compensated.</p>
          <p class="purple">As our collective grew, our vision also began to evolve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-3 vision">
          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9 vision">
          <p>Premier Tutors Group is not your average tutoring company. Firstly, we arenâ€™t a
company. We are a collective. We are a team of tutors, proofreaders and directors
who work together to provide our students with the best quality of service.</p>
          <p>We believe in social, inclusive learning, and we provide many opportunities to meet
and socialize with other tutors and students.</p>
          <p>We have two main goals at PTG.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we want to create a bridge that extends from high school through until after
graduation: a support network between those who are seeking help for the next
stage of their education, and those who have already been there.</p>
          <p>Our university tutors provide guidance for high school students, while our
professional mentors provide guidance for our university students.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the long term we aim to open a PTG headquarters: a shared space for
students and tutors to work together.</p>
          <p>With classrooms for group tutoring sessions, open plan areas for collaborative
learning and space for seminars and workshops by our professional mentors.</p>

        <div class="col-md-9 values">
          <p>Premier Tutors Group works for our tutors, proofreaders and students. We will
always do our best to make sure our students receive the best education, and our
tutors and proofreaders are fairly treated.</p>
